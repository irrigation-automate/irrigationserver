## Reporting Vulnerabilities

Please report security issues to `security@example.com`. We will respond within 48 hours.

## Authentication

### Password Requirements

- Minimum 12 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character
- Not in common password lists

### Session Management

- JWT with strong signing algorithm (HS512)
- Access token expiry: 15 minutes
- Refresh token expiry: 7 days
- Token rotation on refresh
- Secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- Required for admin accounts
- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) support
- Recovery codes for account recovery

## Data Protection

### Encryption

- Data in transit: TLS 1.2+
- Data at rest: AES-256 encryption
- Password hashing: bcrypt (work factor 12)

### Sensitive Data

- Never log sensitive information
- Mask PII in logs
- Regular security audits

### Data Retention

- User data is retained until account deletion
- Backups are encrypted and stored securely
- Automatic deletion of inactive accounts after 2 years

## API Security

### Rate Limiting

- 100 requests/minute per IP
- 10 authentication attempts/minute per IP
- 1000 requests/minute per authenticated user

### Input Validation

- Validate all user inputs
- Use strong typing
- Sanitize all outputs
- Protect against NoSQL injection
- Use parameterized queries

### CORS Policy

- Restrict origins to trusted domains
- Pre-flight request handling
- No wildcard for credentials

## Dependency Management

### Regular Updates

- Weekly dependency updates
- Automated security patches
- Review of new dependencies

### Vulnerability Scanning

- `npm audit` in CI/CD pipeline
- OWASP Dependency-Check
- Snyk integration

### Approved Dependencies

- Only use well-maintained packages
- Minimum downloads threshold: 10,000/week
- Active maintenance (recent updates)

## Infrastructure Security

### Server Hardening

- Regular OS updates
- Firewall configuration
- SSH key authentication only
- Disable root login
- Fail2ban for SSH protection

### Monitoring

- Log all security events
- Intrusion detection system
- File integrity monitoring
- Regular security scans

### Backup Strategy

- Daily encrypted backups
- Test restoration monthly
- Off-site storage
- 90-day retention policy

## Incident Response

### Reporting

1. Identify and contain the incident
2. Assess the impact
3. Notify affected parties if necessary
4. Remediate vulnerabilities
5. Post-mortem analysis

### Communication

- Internal team notification within 1 hour
- Customer notification within 72 hours (if required by law)
- Public disclosure after patches are available

## Compliance

### GDPR

- Data protection by design
- Right to be forgotten
- Data portability
- Data processing agreements

### OWASP Top 10

- Protection against common vulnerabilities
- Regular security training
- Secure coding practices

## Secure Development Lifecycle

### Code Review

- Mandatory code reviews
- Security-focused checklists
- Automated security testing

### Training

- Annual security training
- Secure coding guidelines
- Phishing awareness

### Threat Modeling

- Regular threat assessments
- Risk analysis for new features
- Security requirements definition
